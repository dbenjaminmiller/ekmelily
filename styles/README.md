Ekmelily Notation Styles
========================

This folder contains a collection of files "TUNING/style-NOTATION.pdf"
which demonstrate all predefined notation styles in all available tunings
of [Ekmelily][], as well as some user-defined notation styles.
Each of them includes:

*   A list of all accidental symbols used in the notation style,
    together with the represented tone fraction,
    its SMuFL code point "U+...", and its glyph name.

*   The usage in a [LilyPond][] input file.

*   Some sample notes with their note names (usually "nederlands" and
    "english") and the tone fractions.

The accidental symbols are from [Ekmelos][] or [Bravura][]
("style-NOTATION-bravura.pdf").
